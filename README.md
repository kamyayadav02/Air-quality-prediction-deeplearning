Air Quality Prediction using Generative AI & Deep Learning
Overview
This project leverages Generative AI and Deep Learning techniques to predict air quality levels (AQI) using historical and environmental data. The goal is to help in forecasting pollution levels for better urban planning and public health awareness.

Features
Predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) using deep learning models.

Uses historical weather and pollution data.

Incorporates Generative AI techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

Supports real-time and batch prediction modes.

Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Git & GitHub

Git LFS (for large datasets)

Dataset
The dataset includes environmental variables like:

PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3

Weather data: temperature, humidity, wind speed

Additional indices: SOI, NOI, RPI, SPMI

Note: The dataset is large.
